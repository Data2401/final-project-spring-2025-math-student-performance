# ðŸ“Š Math Student Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This project dives deep into a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance), which contains data on student performance in a secondary school math program. The dataset features academic, personal, and social aspects of a student's life.

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**:\
Our goal is to determine factors that have the most significant impact on student performance in the math program. In addition, we hope to discover factors which may seem influential based on intuition but prove otherwise after analyzing the data.

ðŸ“‚ **Categories Analyzed**:

-   **School & Demographics**
-   **Family Background**
-   **Academic Support & Study Habits**
-   **Activities & Social Life**
-   **Health & Lifestyle**
-   **Overall Academic Performance**
