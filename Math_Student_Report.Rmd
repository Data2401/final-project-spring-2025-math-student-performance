## Introduction

This project dives deep into a dataset named from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/math-students/data), which contains data on student performance in math programs at two Portuguese secondary schools. The data was collected using school reports and student questionaires and features academic, personal, and social aspects of a student's life.

### Why Is This Interesting?

This dataset is interesting because it shows how multiple aspects of a student's life correlate to their scores in school. In addition, the features (G1, G2, G3) represent period 1-3 of a school year (similar to a midterm in the United States being period 1/2 and finals being 2/2.) This is interesting because you can see if a student's score decreases over time (falling behind gradually due to external factors) or maintains a consistent grade throughout the year- these features also allow a ML model to predict G3 based off G1, G2, and the other external factors.

### Objective

Our goal is to determine factors that have the most significant impact on student performance in the math program. In addition, we hope to discover factors which may seem influential based on intuition but prove otherwise after analyzing the data.

### Categories Analyzed

#### üìç Logistics & School Choice

- traveltime ‚Äî Home to school travel time (1 to 4 scale)
- reason ‚Äî Reason for choosing the school (home, reputation, course, other)

#### üè´ School & Demographics

- Do students from different schools (GP vs MS) show significant differences in final performance (G3)?
- Is there an interaction between romantic relationships and gender on academic performance?

#### üë™ Family Background

- Do students with higher parental education (Medu/Fedu) perform better in math?
- Does having family support at home (famsup) help students perform better in school?

#### üéì Academic Support & Study Habits

- Which factors (e.g., studytime, failures, goout, health) are the most predictive of final grades (G3)?
- Does weekly study time affect performance consistently across all three grading periods (G1, G2, G3)?

#### üèÉ Activities & Social Life

- Do students who have a romantic relationship perform differently from those who don‚Äôt?
- Is there a relationship between students‚Äô participation in extracurricular activities and their number of absences?

#### üç∑ Health & Lifestyle

- What is the relationship between alcohol consumption (weekdays Dalc vs weekends Walc) and final grades?
- Do students with internet access and more activities have more school absences than others?

#### üß† Academic Performance

- Do students who fail more subjects in the past continue to perform poorly in current grading periods?
- How consistent are students‚Äô performances across G1, G2, and G3? Is there improvement or decline over time?

## Load Packages

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
```

We utilized the following libraries:

-   **dplyr** for data manipulation.
-   **ggplot2** for creating plots.
-   **plotly** to add interactivity to the plots.
-   **DT** to display the data prettier. üåà

## Data Cleaning

```{r echo=FALSE}
raw <- read.csv("Math-Students.csv")
#Rename cols, convert to factors, add any necessary levels, transmute to drop old columns
formatted <- raw %>% transmute(
  school = as.factor(school),
  sex = as.factor(sex),
  age = age,
  address = as.factor(address),
  fam_size = as.factor(famsize),
  parental_stat = as.factor(Pstatus),
  mom_edu = factor(Medu, levels = 0:4, ordered = TRUE),
  dad_edu = factor(Fedu, levels = 0:4, ordered = TRUE),
  mom_job = as.factor(Mjob),
  dad_job = as.factor(Fjob),
  attend_reason = as.factor(reason),
  guardian = as.factor(guardian),
  travel_time = traveltime,
  study_time = studytime,
  failures = failures,
  school_support = as.factor(schoolsup),
  family_support = as.factor(famsup),
  extra_paid_classes = as.factor(paid),
  activities = as.factor(activities),
  nursery_school = as.factor(nursery),
  pursue_higher_edu = as.factor(higher),
  internet_use = as.factor(internet),
  romantic = as.factor(romantic),
  family_relationship = factor(famrel, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE),
  free_time = factor(freetime, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE),
  go_out_w_friends = factor(goout, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE),
  workday_alcohol = factor(Dalc, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE),
  weekend_alcohol = factor(Walc, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE),
  health = factor(health, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE),
  absences = absences,
  period1_grade = G1,
  period2_grade = G2,
  period3_grade = G3
)
```

```{r}
datatable(formatted, 
          options = list(pageLength = 10,
                         scrollX = TRUE, 
                         autoWidth = TRUE, 
                         columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = "_all"))), 
          rownames = FALSE)
sum(is.na(formatted))
```

Character columns have been converted to factors, and those with levels have been ordered.

There are no missing values in the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r fig.align='center'}
#Make correlation table
cor_df <- formatted %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% cor(use = "complete.obs") %>% 
  as.table() %>% as.data.frame()

colnames(cor_df) <- c("Var1", "Var2", "Correlation")

cor_df %>% ggplot(aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Correlation)) + 
  geom_tile(color = 'white') + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = '#067bc2', mid = 'white', high = '#fe4a49', 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), name = 'Correlation') +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap", x = '', y = '') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

**Intuitive relationships:**

-   Grades from all three periods are strongly positively correlated.
-   Grades are negatively correlated with the number of failures.

**Some relationships to look into more:**

-   Travel time is inversely proportional to study time.
-   Number of failures is positively correlated to travel time; negatively correlated with study time.

**Features not in the correlation heatmap: (Potential 3rd Degrees of Comparison)**

-   All factor features, including but not limited to: parental, financial, and social details.
