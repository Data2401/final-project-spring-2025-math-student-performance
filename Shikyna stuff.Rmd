## From a gazillion datasets, why this one?

- Clean, Structured and small:
Easy to work with, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate learners. Even a 7 year old would be able to look at it and make some comment on it.

- Focused on Math Performance:
Unlike other data sets, this one is specified on math student performance (like a zoom in), hence more insights and you can go in more depth.

- Rich Demographic Features which demonstrate equity and policy insights:
Includes data like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation.

- Equity and Policy Insights:
Enables exploration of how social and economic factors influence education.

## Students and alcohol? Romantic relationships? Is that even legal?

Valid question.

- Reality Check:
Just because something is not legal doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt happen. We're trying to understand how real-life behaviors (like drinking or dating) might affect school performance.

- Cultural Context:
The dataset is from Portugal, where norms can be a little different. For example, some families may introduce teens to alcohol in small, supervised amounts, especially during meals.

- Insight, Not Endorsement:
Including this data doesn‚Äôt mean anyone‚Äôs encouraging it. It‚Äôs about spotting trends. Like‚Äî‚ÄúDo students in relationships do better or worse in math?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs there a pattern between alcohol use and test scores?‚Äù

- Helping, Not Policing: The goal is to help educators and policymakers understand what‚Äôs really going on so they can support students better, not to get anyone in trouble.
